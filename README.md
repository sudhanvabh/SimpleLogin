# SimpleLogin

## Project Overview
This python script is my first projects demonstrates basic user authentication. The script allows users to create a new account with a username and password, then log in using their credentials. 

## Future Plans
- ~~To store passwords in a .csv file instead of a dictionary~~ DONE!
- To implement encryption of passwords in the csv file

## Features
- **User Registration:** Allows new users to register by creating a username and password.
- **Login Functionality:** Existing users can log in using their credentials.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are stored securely using basic encryption methods (to be implemented).
- **Individual files:** After registration, each user is assigned a text file that is only accisible by them. They can read, append or or modify the file as per their needs.

## Usage
- Run the python file by moving it in a seperate designated folder
